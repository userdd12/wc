"""
Linear regression is the most basic type of regression commonly used for
predictive analysis. The idea is pretty simple: we have a dataset and we have
features associated with it. Features should be chosen very cautiously
as they determine how much our model will be able to make future predictions.
We try to set the weight of these features, over many iterations, so that they best
fit our dataset. In this particular code, I had used a CSGO dataset (ADR vs
Rating). We try to best fit a line through dataset and estimate the parameters.
